## Smart QR Menus for your Restaurant

Smart QR Menus is a web application that uses GPT-3 to parse text or PDF menus and saves them to a database. With this app, restaurant owners can simply paste the text or upload a PDF of their menu, and the app will do the rest. The menus will later also be translated into several languages, making it easy for customers to navigate and order from the menu in their preferred language.

This project is designed to help restaurant owners create and manage their menus more efficiently, saving them time and money. With the app's easy-to-use interface, restaurant owners can quickly create and update their menus, ensuring that their customers always have access to the latest offerings.

Whether you're a small cafe or a large restaurant, Smart QR Menus can help simplify your menu management process and provide your customers with an enhanced dining experience.
